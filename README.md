# Bruen
Bruen Project for my Summer 2024 Data Analytics Internship at the Bronx Defenders. W/ Max Gilligan.

## Description
Analysis of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n (NYSRPA) v. Bruen Supreme Court Ruling - we looked at whether the ruling had any quantitative impact on criminal possession of weapon charges (CWP) in New York State. Ultimately, we found that there was no significant changes between CWP charges pre- and post- Bruen ruling.

See the bruen_raw_data dir for datasets we used.

See the ipynb file for data processing (as well as more detailed program comments).

See the results dir for the CSV files exported from the ipynb file.

See the bruen_graphics dir for the R script I used to generate data visualizations (and the actual graphics themselves).
