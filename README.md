# Bruen
Bruen Project for my Summer 2024 Data Analytics Internship at the Bronx Defenders. W/ Max Gilligan.

## Description
Analysis of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n v. Bruen Supreme Court Ruling - we looked at whether the ruling had any quantitative impact on criminal weapons possession (CWP) charges in New York City (with cross-Borough and cross-race analysis as well). Ultimately, we found that there was no significant changes between CWP charges before and after Bruen.

See the ipynb file for more detailed program comments; See the results folder for the actual data visuals/graphics produced and presented.
